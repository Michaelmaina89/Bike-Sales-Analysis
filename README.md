# Bike Sales Analysis Project
**Author:** Michael Maina Mwangi

## Project Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze customer demographics and lifestyle factors to identify key drivers for bike purchases. This data helps in creating targeted marketing strategies for a bike retail business.

## Data Cleaning Process
- **Duplicate Removal:** Removed 26 duplicate records to ensure data integrity.
- **Standardization:** Updated Gender (M/F to Male/Female) and Marital Status (M/S to Married/Single).
- **Feature Engineering:** Created "Age Brackets" using Excel formulas to group customers into Adolescent (25-30), Middle Age (31-54), and Old (55+).

## Key Insights
- **Target Demographic:** The **Middle Age (31-54)** group is the most active buyer segment.
- **Income Correlation:** Customers who purchased bikes have a higher average income (**Ksh 57,475**) compared to non-buyers.
- **Commute Factor:** People living within **0-1 miles** of work are significantly more likely to buy a bike than those living further away.
